= Wiki generator tests =
== Paragraph test ==
This is a simple test for the web/article generator.
It takes wiki pages and produces HTML and LaTeX output.
It also takes a content folder with html fragments and
embeds them on a scheletton.
The idea is to have the benefits of a wiki syntax
but maintain the files on a SVN server and editing
them using your favorite editor (vim?) instead of
the web interface.

Paragraph are separated by an empty line.
Like the one before.

== Lists tests ==


# first
# second

# new first

# parent 1
## child 1
## child 2
### subchild 1
## child 3
# parent 2


Paragraph touching the itemization
* item
*# inner numerated
*#*#*# Complex subitemization
*#***# Should go back to the common one
Paragraph touching the itemization

== Special paragraphs ==

 Placing space or tabulators
 creates a preformatted environment
 	The first space is removed but the rest are kept

Abstract:
Some special paragraphs can be defined by preceding them by a
colon ended keyword such as 'Abstract:'

Keywords:
And the Keywords: special paragraph

== Toc generation ==

Headers generate labels.
They can be refered from a Table of Content.
This is the place holder for a Table of Content

%(toc)s

The index header doesn't appear on the ToC.
The ToC in LaTeX output is ignored.

== Images and figures ==
Label: OtherLabel

Full featured figures can be generated by using the 'Figure:' special word
Figure: MyLabel MyImage.jpg Alt text
This is the caption text.
Til the next empty line.

Math:
a\over{b}

Equation:
a\over{b}

TODO: This is a pending task


== Inline substitutions ==

Normal ''emphasis'' Normal. ''Another emphasis'' Normal
Normal ''em'phasis'' Normal. ''Another emphasis'' Normal.
Normal '''bold''' Normal. '''Another bold''' Normal.
Normal '''bold ''emphasis'' more bold. don't ''' Normal. '''Another bold''' Normal.
Normal ''emphasis '''bold don't''' more emphasis'' Normal. '''Another bold''' Normal.

`r_iO_i=r_jI_j`

Were `r_i` and `r_j` are the number of times that node i and node j will be fired during a period. The vector `\vec{r}` gives the number of repetitions for each node.
