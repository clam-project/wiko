<title>Simplifying Spectral processing in CLAM</title>
<description>Current &lt;a href="http://clam.iua.upf.edu"&gt;CLAM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='http://clam.iua.upf.edu/doc/CLAM-doxygen/classCLAM_1_1Spectrum.html'&gt;Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; implementation has four different internal representations: Complex array, polar array, separated magnitude and phase buffers, and separated magnitude and phase break point functions (point controled envelopes). Conversion and synchronization among such representations were handled by the Spectrum class itself and this was intended to be transparent. But processing algorithms had to know which representations were already present to trade off between doing conversion and applying different versions of a given algorithm depending on the representation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, spectrum product in polar representation is cheaper by itself than complex product, but if you have to convert incoming or outcomming spectrums it migth be not so cheap. What about having two different representations for each operand? Which one should be converted? Output format could be a discriminant but do the module has information to know which is the convenient output representation? Such decissions make the implemention of processings using spectrums really complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, algorithms also had to consider different cases for different scales (linear or dB). So the complexity of processing objects having to deal with spectra is very high. A lot of code dealt with querying the presence of a given representation or synchronizing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we decided to simplify all that by having several kind of spectrum for each representation and doing any representation change explicit by a converter processing. We are currently considering just two spectrum classes: MagPhaseSpectrum and ComplexSpectrum. We added also converters to the current Spectrum to enable progressive migration. The implementation of FFT and IFFT was highly simplified as we don't need to deal with conversions and prototypes configuration, just to input or output complex spectra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a setup of a system which perform complex and polar products of two spectra:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width='90' src='http://iua-share.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/thumb/5/59/OptimizingSpectral-Setup.png/800px-OptimizingSpectral-Setup.png' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spectral product has been simplified. Now we have a product for each kind of spectrum in contrast with the previous situation where we had a single module containing implementations for every combinations of inputs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Code is really simpler to understand and write this way. After having all that we could do a profiling on comparing which is best, conversions and cheap product or no conversions and expensive product. The option without conversions won but the situation can change on the future depending on the optimizations we could do on the conversion. Having the processing modules factored that way we could change them and doing the benchmark that easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the process of takin such decission we noticed that some elementary CLAM elements such as the AudioSource, AudioSink and specially AudioMixer were taking too much CPU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src='http://iua-share.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/thumb/b/b6/OptimizingSpectral-Before.png/555px-OptimizingSpectral-Before.png' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After fixing that we got a clear profile that highlights which is the proper strategy for spectrum product for our concrete case. Callgrind is a really nice tool:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src='http://iua-share.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/thumb/f/f6/OptimizingSpectral-After.png/568px-OptimizingSpectral-After.png' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hope we can move soon to that new way of doing spectral processing in CLAM but still a lot of code must be updated.</description>

A &lt;a href="http://iua-share.upf.edu/svn/clam/trunk/CLAM/src/Processing/Plugins/RunTimeProcessingLibraryLoader.cxx"&gt;single class&lt;/a&gt; did the work. There is still some work to do on documenting the registration of the configuration dialogs for the processings and making the Processing Tree of the network editor to populate automatically from the factory content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The former can be done very quick by adding the Qt4 configurator as a CLAM library, but we want to provide a more general solution not requiring users linking against Qt4. The later (processing tree population) is something Andreas Calvo is working with. And he is doing nice progresses.</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2007/07/clam-plugins.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-1806878978202284767</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2007 11:58:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-07-02T05:34:16.653-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>clam</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>mingw</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>wine</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>crosscompilation</category><title>Deprecating Windows as development platform</title><description>In this entry i will explain how we got ride of Windows as development platform for the CLAM project still providing Windows binaries by using the tandem mingw32 (for Linux) and Wine. We dealt with crosscompilation of most of CLAM dependencies such as Portaudio, Asio, libsndfile, liboggvorbis, pthreads, fftw3, libmad, id3lib, XercesC, libxml++, NSIS and Py2Exe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/5/5f/MingwWindowsNetEditor.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a very dissapointing and fustrating effort from &lt;a href="http://parumi.wordpress.com/"&gt;Pau&lt;/a&gt; and me of trying to have a reproducible build environment for &lt;a href="http://clam.iua.upf.edu"&gt;CLAM&lt;/a&gt; based on Visual Express 2005, we decided that the whole thing was foolish and decided give mingw a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am proud of not having a Windows box available at home ;-) but that doesn't mean i cannot contribute to that part of the development so the last days i did an spike on having &lt;a href="http://www.mingw.org/"&gt;mingw&lt;/a&gt; crosscompiling CLAM from Linux! We succeeded to compile it all, the dependencies, CLAM and the applications. Because some dll conflicts when installing that could not go into the 1.1.0 version of CLAM. After a gutsy update we could compile it all,&lt;br /&gt;so expect rewamped windows binaries for the next release... and maybe development binaries. You can already give a try to the &lt;a href="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/download/win/svnsnapshots/"&gt;latest svn snapshots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key point has been using &lt;a href="http://www.winehq.org/"&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; to install with their own windows installers some libraries and tools such as &lt;a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt"&gt;Qt4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.gtk.org/"&gt;GTK&lt;/a&gt; (for pkg-config, libxml++ and dependencies), and &lt;a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/"&gt;NSIS&lt;/a&gt; to build windows installers from Linux!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wine and mingw are a great tandem to compile and test the binaries. Also SConstruct has been a nice tool to hack a quick build environment for third party libraries when the one provided (normally based on autotools) was too messy to get on with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We kept a reproducible &lt;a href="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Devel/Windows_MinGW_cross_compile"&gt;log of the mingw crosscompilation&lt;/a&gt; at the clam wiki. This includes how to get all the dependencies working, which may be usefull for you own project. CLAM dependencies we addressed were: Portaudio, Asio, libsndfile, liboggvorbis, pthreads, fftw3, libmad, id3lib, XercesC, libxml++, NSIS and Py2Exe.</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2007/07/deprecating-windows-as-development.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-3868559389262659290</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2007 21:49:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-10-18T10:03:58.394-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>knob</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>clam</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>widgets</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>qt</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>rosegarden</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>qsynth</category><title>Enhancing QSynth/Rosegarden/SonicVisualizer knobs for CLAM</title><description>I am still expanding the widgets toolbox for &lt;a href="http://clam.iua.upf.edu"&gt;CLAM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/4/43/Qsynth-knobs-shadows1.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://pksampler.sourceforge.net/"&gt;PK Widgets&lt;/a&gt;, the ones in my previos blog entry, are really nice but they don't integrate well with other widgets because the background and the fixed size. So you have to do a mostly PK interface or not. Most standard Qt widgets look nice with a nice theme such plastique, but for some reason QDial is the ugly duck of the collection... well, according &lt;a href="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/cannam/"&gt;Chris Cannam&lt;/a&gt;, also QLCD. I agree with him. QDial looks like old CDE style in every style you choose:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/images/plastique-dial.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the look, QDial behaviour is far from optimal. Clicking on any point jumps the pointer which is a bad thing if you want to progressively control a parameter. Also when you move the knob beyond one of the extremes you may switch sharply to the other extreme. Using such a mischievous control in a live performance could be a disaster. So let's look for asthetic and behavioral alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the look, I just liked a lot the knobs in &lt;a href="http://qsynth.sourceforge.net/"&gt;QSynth&lt;/a&gt; a program by &lt;a href="http://www.rncbc.org/drupal/"&gt;Rui Nuno Capella&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://qsynth.sourceforge.net/image/qsynthMainForm1.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The knobs indeed were taken from &lt;a href="http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/"&gt;Rosegarden&lt;/a&gt; and Pedro Lopez Cabanillas enhanced the look by adding some nice but expensive gradients. The ones that attracted me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took those widgets with such a long trail and I extended them.&lt;br /&gt;I ported them to Qt4 using QGradients which are faster, and i did some visual improvements: shadows, bumped pointer, configurable colors, angular and linear modes of mouse handling... I added them to the CLAM Widgets plugin and added some configurability so you can change the colors from the designer. And that's how they look now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/4/43/Qsynth-knobs-shadows1.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/5/58/Qsynth-knobs-shadows2.png"/&gt;</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2007/04/enhancing-qsynthrosegardensonicvisualiz.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-117614223874732595</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2007 18:09:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-05-10T05:39:18.401-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>clam</category><title>PK Widgets integration in CLAM</title><description>And last but not least, the other important change i added this Easter to CLAM has been integrating &lt;a href="http://www.patrickkidd.com/"&gt;Patrick Kidd&lt;/a&gt;'s PkWidgets. This was a really dormant to-do. A working implemtation was on the 'draft' cvs from 2004.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 2004, Patrick &lt;a href="http://lalists.stanford.edu/lad/2004/09/0199.html"&gt;amazed the LAD community&lt;/a&gt; with his nice looking PKSampler. I must confess that I never got PKSampler sounding because a bunch of missing dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu. But, a part from the audio work, the interface was really gorgeous. Something that was not so common on the Linux Audio scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice look was mostly due to a clever combination of free technologies: Qt, Python and Povray. Povray rendered 3D widgets with a realistic look, Qt the interface foundation and the resource system and Python to glue it all.&lt;br /&gt;A clever trick allows to load povray images as frames of an interactive animation to render a widget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that time I was starting what is now the Prototyper and I was already messing with designer plugins, i could not stand and I ported some of the Patrick widgets to C++ in order to include them in a Designer plugin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exchanged some mails with him but the code was left on CLAM draft repository... until Saturday. I updated it to Qt4, added some configuration features, merged some of the new pixmaps and i integrated them on the CLAMWidgets plugin. The result, now you can prototype with CLAM interfaces such that one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/thumb/d/d1/Pkwidgets-fun2.png/800px-Pkwidgets-fun2.png"/&gt;</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2007/04/pk-widgets-integration-in-clam.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-117613807226375341</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2007 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-05-10T05:39:18.401-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>clam</category><title>Educational Vowel Synth and ControlSurface Widget</title><description>Some months ago I had the idea of doing a Vowel Synthesizer program which could help children to understand why the vowel triangle has some sense and it also could be used to train foreign language vowels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/VowelTriangle.PNG/350px-VowelTriangle.PNG"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The core of the idea is that axes correspond mostly to the position of the first two formants F1 and F2. So by a simple mapping, given a point on the triangle you could synthesize any vowel even those in the middle. Also by analyzing incoming voice from a microphone, the system could place a point in the triangle that identifies how far one is from the intended vowel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/thumb/d/d6/Vowels.png/800px-Vowels.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a first prototype which synthesized something far from human but at least you can identify the vowels when you place the proper frequencies. As i had a proof of concept i stopped there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/thumb/e/e7/ControlSurface.png/609px-ControlSurface.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This easter i improved the prototype by adding a new control widget: The ControlSurface, which control two parameters by moving a single point. It is really more handy than having two sliders and it is perfect for parameter exploration, not just for the Vowel Synthesizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will also force a change on the way the CLAM Prototyper address the binding of controls as it controls two parameters and our current system binds a widget to a single inlet.</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2007/04/educational-vowel-synth-and.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-117613356734915479</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2007 15:14:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-05-10T05:39:18.401-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>clam</category><title>Realtime MFCC and LPC analysis</title><description>As I said on the previous blog entry, too much things done in CLAM this Easter. We fully dropped Fltk visualization module from the main libraries. Zach Welch (one of the active new commers) ported Voice2Midi to Qt4 and we moved a subset of the Qt3 visualization module to the SMSTools and dropped the rest. (Zach prepared a set of patches to port it to Qt4 but let's wait until the rewrite). All those drops mean that CLAM size has been reduced to a half of its former size: less mainteinance and faster entry for the new developers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few examples stopped being functional because they used Fltk Plots. One of them the LPC_example. It compiled by disabling visualization rendered the example useless. I decided to convert it into a Network Editor example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some hacking i had this piece of network working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/3/38/LPC.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some designer and prototyper hacking i got this interface:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/2/2e/LPC-prototyper.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to understand the meaning of the LPC I also added a new output the spectral envelope:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/4/49/LPC-envelope.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it captures the spectral envelope which is gonna be very useful for the vowel synth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a user asked for realtime MFCC. As we already had the processings but using portless interface, and LPC visualization could be reused for MFCC, i also took this task. The result:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/9/9c/Mfcc.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixing it all in a single analysis interface&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/d/df/Mfcc-lpc.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vowel formants are even more clear in MelSpectrum that in MelCepstrum or the Spectrum it self. Another idea to be used for the Educational Vowel Synth.</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2007/04/realtime-mfcc-and-lpc-analysis.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-117613150459209038</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2007 14:38:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-05-10T05:39:18.401-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>clam</category><title>Realtime Voice Gender Change</title><description>This Easter has been very productive for the CLAM framework. Holidays and a bunch of new developers that have aproximated the team during these weeks have accelerated a lot the development which had already been accelerated during last months. As consequence, a lot of dormant to-do's has been addressed and most of them deserve a blog entry (pixmap widgets, realtime LPC/MFCC, Qt3/Fltk drop, Qt4 ports, new visualization widgets, new control widgets...). Just take a look at the &lt;a href="http://llistes.projectes.lafarga.org/pipermail/clam-devel/2007/thread.html"&gt;CLAM-devel mailing list archives&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Development_screenshots"&gt;development screenshots&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see a im not exagerating. So let's start from the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the nicer things I worked on and which is going to be the star on CLAM demos for sure, is the voice Gender Change effect on the NetworkEditor. Since Xavier implemented the offline version, it has been arround for a while on the SMSTools turning Elvis voice into Elvira. It was also on the NetworkEditor but crashing or not even sounding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am a demo whore, let's make people smile. Let's make it realtime. Pau already did some work as he ported almost all the SMS transformation. I just had to fix some of the internal processings, the Pitch shift, and the SpectralShapeShift. Most of the bugs were about detecting non-harmonic parts and figure out which is the best strategy in those cases. In some case this was detected but the action relied on input to output copies implicit on the offline version but not on the realtime one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What i was not able to solve is the CombFilter. It added a really extrident noise to the residual part. So I disabled it and it does not sound as perfet but... tada! i started listening my sister voice from the speakers instead of mine when i talked the mic, which is specially frightening, most of you know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the look the network had after having the system completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/thumb/5/5b/Genderchange.png/800px-Genderchange.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a first attemp Prototyper interface for an stand alone application:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://clam.iua.upf.edu/wikis/clam/images/a/a7/Genderchange-interface2.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as it is available as nightly snapshots try it. It is worth to listen. My first experiments i used it to learn how to do a mixt choir in Ardour with just my own voice.</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2007/04/realtime-voice-gender-change.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-116983070021456366</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2007 16:57:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-05-10T05:39:18.402-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>clam</category><title>Adding dynamic libraries to a macosx application bundle</title><description>&lt;a href="http://clam.iua.upf.edu"&gt;CLAM&lt;/a&gt; team is now geared toward having again MacOSX binary distribution.  We are learning how things in Mac works and it is being a long process.  At last it seems that we are getting enough insight.  Until now, our Mac packages for CLAM applications depended on the installation of another bundle with clam and third party libraries.  Following the advice of Volker Schumacher this would be more handy by having, as we have in windows, all third party libraries within the handle.  So we used otool and install_name_tool as the mac developer documentation says.  But CLAM has a lot of third party dependencies which are recursive and this was a very hard problem to do it by hand, so &lt;a href="http://parumi.wordpress.com"&gt;Pau&lt;/a&gt; and me pair programmed a handy python script which eases the process a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does is firstly using otool to retrieve all the dependencies recursively and removes system ones.  Then it copies all them to the bundle, changes their id and then changes all cross references among libraries and applications accordantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://iua-share.upf.edu/svn/CLAM/trunk/scons/sconstools/addDependentLibsToBundle.py"&gt;The script&lt;/a&gt; is available on the CLAM svn repository.  A SCons tool is also work in progress. I will wrote more on int when finished.</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2007/01/adding-dynamic-libraries-to-macosx.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-116950956001027922</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2007 23:28:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-01-22T15:56:20.170-08:00</atom:updated><title>BBQed onion springs and Tux evangelism</title><description>Last Saturday I could not attend an interesting meeting in Barcelona for the startup of a &lt;a href="http://www.softcatala.org/wiki/Organitzacio_PLL"&gt;new organization&lt;/a&gt; which has the goal of compensating the increasing privative software lobbing over our &lt;a href="http://www.gencat.cat"&gt;autonomous government in Catalonia&lt;/a&gt;. I was not able to go because I scheduled for the same day, a typical Catalan BBQ like event, a &lt;a href="http://www.altcamp.info/eng/calcotada.htm"&gt;Calçotada&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway I still used that other event to promote Tux cause ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Because my Linux laptop was the jukebox for the event. As result I got some of my friends using &lt;a href="http://amarok.kde.org/"&gt;Amarok&lt;/a&gt; to choose the music they wanted and they liked much the program. Even those that declared themselves completely newbies with computers managed to get some of their music playing. I also activated &lt;a href="http://www.beryl-project.org/"&gt;Beryl&lt;/a&gt; which impressed them a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free CD's to Mario's Pub, chatting about cool linux features... Anything as effective as seeing it running and managing it. When I told them that that was Linux they all said comfortable comments such 'so, it is not as difficult as people says' and 'it's like windows but cooler!'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my friends asked me to install Kubuntu on his desktop computer. I told one of them to do it yesterday but, sincerely we were too hangover. I must say there were more things in there than Linux evangelism. And pretty funny ones.</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2007/01/bbqed-onion-springs-and-tux-evangelism.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-116724967666376213</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2006 19:57:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-12-27T12:04:03.616-08:00</atom:updated><title>Command of the day: convmv</title><description>If you are moving around files from one system  (ubuntu: default encoding is utf8) to another (debian: historical default encoding for catalonians who want to use the euro sign is latin1) or getting files from CD's built in windows (spanish windows encoding cp850), you surelly will get on the filenames strange signs instead accents, tilded n's and c's with cedillas, opening question marks... not talking about the weird (for us) nordic and eastern signs. You may say that using such names for files is getting in trouble, but i like them for mp3 in order to convert back and forward from id3 tags to filenames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that i have to move to another office and another computer i had such filename encoding problems. I knew how to convert the encoding of the content of a file with iconv how to solve that problem on the file names. 'apt-cache search' gave me the solution: convmv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it recursively with an '-r' option, it detects which files are already on utf8 and you have to explicitly indicate the 'from' and 'to' encodings. It will be nice it to detect the original encoding when there is no conflict but, at least it lets you do a temptative conversion and see how it would look after conversion. So the way of working is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a temptative conversion for all the files you need to convert:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; convmv -f latin1 -t utf8 -r . | less&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the output and see whether the non utf8 files have been properly converted. If some files were not latin1 neither utf8, the name will be not properly converted, just prove a different origin encoding for those concrete files. When you know which is the encoding to translate just execute:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; convmv -f latin1 -t utf8 -r . --notest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the applied conversion was not the proper one, just apply the conversion backwards and you'll have&lt;br /&gt;the original one again.</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2006/12/command-of-day-convmv.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-116387959622826265</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2006 19:43:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-10-18T10:13:32.276-07:00</atom:updated><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>clam</category><category domain='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#'>qt</category><title>Why my qt plugins are not loading?</title><description>That was a question i asked myself hundred of times while &lt;a href="http://iua-share.upf.edu/wikis/clam/index.php/Development_screenshots"&gt;developing&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://clam.iua.upf.edu"&gt;CLAM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://iua-share.upf.es/wikis/clam/index.php/Image:NetEditQt4-Prototyper-PolarChromaPeaks.png"&gt;Prototyper&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="http://www.trolltech.com/qt"&gt;Qt4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Plugins don't load, i get no message and the ninety nine other reasons i found the last days are not happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wrote &lt;a href="http://www.iua.upf.edu/~dgarcia/Codders/qtpluginnotloading.html"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; that collects the experience i got to spot and fix such problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2006/11/why-my-qt-plugins-are-not-loading.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-116191617184892209</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2006 02:14:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-10-26T19:55:17.636-07:00</atom:updated><title>Californimedia</title><description>After the PLoP we took a jet to Santa Barbara for the ACM-Multimedia conference. What a weather change!! We left Portland raining and Santa Barbara weather seems like the one at Barcelona in July!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a pity because while preparing the CLAM demo we missed most of the talks. Yesterday we received the prize to the best opensource multimedia project for CLAM and today we did the demo having some unrelevant logistic problems. The audience got the rapid prototyping idea very well, as we intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw few paper presentations. The one left i felt interesting for us was about extracting brush patterns to identify painting style/author. We assisted but, sadly, we were solving some problems with our demo and we couldn't pay the attention the topic required to understand it properly. :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the presentations were about video. Nearly none about audio but ours and Peter and Markus' poster. We meet those nice guys at the ISMIR last year. They have done a very nice and impressive work on navigating music collections. Tomorrow the Audio workshop starts, so we'll get our audio meat. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being about multimedia you can feel the shadow of two of the most successful phenomena in internet this year: Google Maps and YouTube. A lot of papers were about integrating geographical information with media and social networks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xavi, which is very busy with the conference arrangements took us yesterday to the UCSB (the university were he works in). He showed us the Allosphere project which is an impressive multimedia installation that puts you into a interactive 3D world.</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2006/10/californimedia.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-116191513453321415</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2006 01:42:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-10-26T20:00:38.716-07:00</atom:updated><title>Unplop</title><description>I was amazed with the insight we got on our own pattern at the PLoP writer's workshow. You can learn a lot by having seven experts on patterns talking behind you about your paper without you being able to talk, just listening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a pity that we had relation mostly with the people on our workshop, but, anyway, people in our workshop was very interesting to know. No doubt about Ralph, but also Jason, Amr, Hishem, Dirk, Paddy, Leon... all of them gave us very valuable feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A part from Jason's paper, the one about stand-up meetings i already commented, the other i liked the more was the one about Functional testing. Regardless pattern like formatting flaws it contained a lot of insight on functional testing that will help Pau and me to better communicate the functional tests principles to our Software Engineering students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the games, a funny one we played was the one of segregating people by things we thought make each one weird. Just 5 of about 40 keept on one side on the statement 'I don't use windows'. Of those 5, 3 were Mac'ers. Having that much veterans computer scientists, was very interesting the segregation on statements about knowing weird programming languages and having using old technologies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really enjoied our first PLoP. I hope we could be back some year.</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2006/10/unplop.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-116149822921588311</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2006 05:44:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-10-21T23:43:41.573-07:00</atom:updated><title>Plopping, first day</title><description>&lt;p&gt;PLoP (Pattern Languages of Programming) conference is really a weird one. We were already shocked by the paper 'admission' and paper review process and, the conference itself has started in the same weird/unusual way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's nice to see a core of veteran people to meet each other so touched. It's a family that joins once a year since 1994 and most of them are old workmates of the old smaltalker times. All the organization was all but formal what i really like. They also made us to play some games in order to break communication walls. Also the main purpose of the conference itself it is a major novelty for us. It is not about presenting your work and know what others are doing but about helping authors to improve our work by discussing the papers we submitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have meet some big names on the Software Engineering field. We sitted just beside &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham"&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt;, the inventor of the wiki among other things. We also meet &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Johnson"&gt;Ralph Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four_(software)"&gt;GoF&lt;/a&gt;, which is the moderator of our discussion group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the discussion itself, we discussed two interesting papers. One about the Value Object pattern, that highlighted some insightfull consequences i even never had thought about. The other was really interesting and funny to read because it explained some patterns to have a successfull 'standup meeting' and some 'bad smells' to dectect when things are not working properly. It was very funny because it highlighted meeting situations we all have experienced and the solutions he proposed were very clever and pleasant to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;</description><link>http://vokicodder.blogspot.com/2006/10/plopping-first-day.html</link><author>Vokimon</author></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-36421488.post-116149579285910984</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2006 05:39:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2006-10-21T22:43:12.866-07:00</atom:updated><title>Starting up</title><description>The purpose of this blog is to post entries about open source and code development, mostly technical.
