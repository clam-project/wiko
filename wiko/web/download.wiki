If you don't know how to use ''subversion'', you still can just download the script:

* [[https://wiko.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wiko/wiko/wiko WiKo]]
The main script which compiles it all depending on what it finds on the working directory: 
Just wrapping Html into a skeleton, wiki to html, wiki to latex, generating download zones and blogs.

You may find also useful some of the helper scripts:
* [[https://wiko.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wiko/wiko/bib2html.py bib2html.py]]:
** Makes LaTeX bibliography (BibTeX) to also work with generated HTML by aggregating any BibTeX file withing the workind directory into an HTML file and providing anchors to each entry.
* [[https://wiko.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wiko/wiko/generate_figures.py generate_figures.py]]:
** It takes dia, dot, svg and eps figures and converts them into WiKo usable images: png for web and LaTeX and pdf for LaTex.
** Depending on the conversions you need it requires: epstopdf (texlive-extra-utils), dia (dia|dia-gnome), dot (graphviz) and inkscape (inkscape)
* [[https://wiko.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wiko/wiko/generate_gallery.py generate_gallery.py]]:
** ''(Experimental)'' Generates a gallery page using the images on a given directory.
* [[https://wiko.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wiko/wiko/blogger2wiko.py blogger2wiko.py]]:
** ''(Experimental)'' Graphical interface to export blogs entries from a blog at blogger.com
